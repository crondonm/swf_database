# A Global Sovereign Wealth Fund Database

This repository contains data and documentation for **A Global Sovereign Wealth Fund Database**, developed by Acosta-Henao, Martínez, and Rondón-Moreno. The database provides comprehensive information on the **typology, institutional characteristics, and financial assets** of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) across countries and time.

---

## Overview

The database consists of two main components:

### 1. SWF Typology
The institutional component covers **115 sovereign wealth funds across 85 countries between 1953 and 2024**. It classifies each fund according to its *de jure* mandate, distinguishing **stabilization SWFs** from other types of funds, such as savings or strategic funds. Additional institutional and administrative metadata include fund names, reporting institutions, institutional links, source documentation, and dates of last consultation.

### 2. SWF Assets
The financial component is an **annual unbalanced panel** of fund-level data covering **63 sovereign wealth funds across 52 jurisdictions (including Taiwan) over the period 1956–2024**. Each observation corresponds to a specific SWF in a given year and reports key balance-sheet and asset measures. Due to differences in fund creation dates, reporting practices, and data availability, not all funds are observed in all years.

The combined dataset is suitable for empirical research on sovereign wealth funds, fiscal stabilization mechanisms, and the interaction between SWFs and foreign reserve accumulation.
